# Termux Tmux Automation Script for Server Launching

This repository contains a Python script that automates the creation of a tmux session on Termux. The script sets up four tmux panes, where each pane runs a specific command. This can be useful for managing multiple tasks simultaneously in a terminal environment, such as starting Jellyfin, configuring FileBrowser, monitoring the system, and enabling SSH on Termux.

## How it works?

The code creates a new tmux session with four panes. Each pane automatically executes one of the following commands:

1. **Pane 1**: Runs the `jellyfin.sh` script located in `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/docker`.
2. **Pane 2**: Starts FileBrowser, listening on port 7075 and allowing access to the `/data/data/com.termux/files/home` directory.
3. **Pane 3**: Runs the `Monitor.sh` script located in `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/TermuxMonitor`.
4. **Pane 4**: Enables the SSH service and displays `sshd` logs using the `logcat` command.

## How to run?

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Make sure you have tmux installed on your Termux.
3. Run the Python script. It will create a tmux session and set up the panes automatically.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gabrick75/TermuxServerLauncher
cd TermuxServerLauncher
python3 init.py
```
